The function ``generate_randomPDmatrix`` generates a random positive-definite matrix with a user-specified
condition number and with the smallest eigenvalue being 1. This is useful when evaluating algorithms for numerical linear algebra, numerical optimization, etc. The script ``randomPDmatrix`` contains the function, along with an example.
